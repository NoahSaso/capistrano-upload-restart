namespace :deploy do
  desc <<-DESC
      Copy files to the currently deployed version. This is useful for updating \
      files piecemeal, such as when you need to quickly deploy only a single \
      file. Some files, such as updated templates, images, or stylesheets, \
      might not require a full deploy, and especially in emergency situations \
      it can be handy to just push the updates to production, quickly.

      To use this task, specify the files and directories you want to copy as a \
      comma-delimited list in the FILES environment variable. All directories \
      will be processed recursively, with all files being pushed to the \
      deployment servers.

        $ cap staging deploy:upload FILES=templates,controller.rb

      Dir globs are also supported:

        $ cap staging deploy:upload FILES='config/apache/*.conf'
  DESC
  task :upload do
    files = (ENV["FILES"] || "").split(",").map { |f| Dir[f.strip] }.flatten
    abort "Please specify at least one file or directory to update (via the FILES environment variable)" if files.empty?

    on release_roles :all do
      files.each { |file| upload!(file, File.join(current_path, file)) }
    end

    invoke "deploy:restart"
  end
end
